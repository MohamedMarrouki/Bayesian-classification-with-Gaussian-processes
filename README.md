Bayesian Classification with Gaussian Processes
This repository houses the code and resources for a project exploring Bayesian Classification using Gaussian Processes. The work specifically applies these techniques to the Pima Indians Diabetes and Crabs datasets, with the primary focus of the accompanying report (and this documentation) being on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset.

Project Overview
This project aims to demonstrate the application of Gaussian Processes for classification tasks. Key areas covered include:

Data Preprocessing: Essential steps to clean and prepare the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, including handling missing values and feature scaling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistical analysis to understand the characteristics and distributions of the dataset's features.
Gaussian Process Classification: Implementation of GP models for classification, focusing on practical aspects and optimization.
Classification Outcomes: Reporting and analysis of the model's performance on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset.
Practical Matters & Limitations: Discussion of challenges encountered during implementation, such as hyperparameter tuning sensitivity, and other real-world considerations.
